This respository contains the contents of all my CAP 4773 (Intro to Data Science and Analytics) submissions ranging from Homework 1 to Homework 4 which is the final.

The goal of each project was to analyze each csv file and catch trends within each one. 

All files were created in the jupyter notebook in an anaconda envrionment, which then was exported as a PDF. All source files and csv files are uploaded accordingly in their respective folders.
